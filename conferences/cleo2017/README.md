This repository contains my contributions to [CLEO2017](http://www.cleoconference.org/home/).
The abstracts are:

* A cautionary tale: why you should not use the
electric field to quantize in nonlinear optics: [abstract](./quantization.pdf), [poster](./quantization.poster.pdf)

* The effects of self- and cross- phase modulation in the generation of bright twin beams using SPDC: [abstract](./phase.pdf), [poster](./phase.poster.pdf)


# Talks that I liked from the conference

## Monday

* SM1M.1 This system takes advantage of the non-equilibrium phase transition that occurs at the oscillation threshold, where the generated signal field phase-locks to the pump field with two possible states that are offset by $\pi$. Uses $\chi^3$ nonlinearity that amplifies vacuum fluctuations at the classical level.
Passes NIST random number tests and has a high rate.

* SM1M2.2 Using nonlinear resonators  (Kerr effect) to measure rotations. Present experimental evidence of effect predicted by Kapland Meystre. The fact that this all happens close to the symmetry breaking allows for enhanced sensitivity.

* JM3E.1  Multiplexing an array of sources. Single photon probability of 65%. Can take to 90%. Switches seems to be an area were a lot can be improved.

## Tuesday

* FTu1E.1 Using frequency modes instead of spatial modes to boson sampling. Beam splitters are replaced by frequency converters. They do it using integrated photonics. You don't need to worry about exactly what are the reflectivities of the optical network since these should be "random" anyway. The distribution is similar to to the uniform measure. The show HOM interference and they could scale up the simulation by using combs. NEAT

* FTu1F.2 Using boson sampling  with gaussian inputs but non gaussian outputs. They show that this is also hard. SHOULD READ THEIR PAPER AND ALSO THE BY Garcia-Patron. NEAT

* FTu1F.3 Doing three photon interference. Need three photon source. The network can always be decomposed into binary *mode* interaction but many photons could live in the same mode.

* FTu1F.5 Using machine learning compiled in a quantum processor to learn about a parameter encoded in a Hamiltonian.

* FTu3D.5 Using a strong field to dress a $\chi^3$ nonlinearity to make it look like a $\chi^2$ nonlinearity. They used this for FC. You have a *very* nonlinear process but you still have to worry XPM and SPM.

* FTu4D.3 Generating bright quasi-classical light in chip?

* FTu4D.5 FC in Lithium Niobate with a compression factor of 7.47 and efficiency of 61.5% . Better (or almost) than a filter.

* FTu4D.6 Smith-Purcell effect: Charged particle "flying over" a periodic structure generated radiating dipole. If particle approaching de-Broglie wavelength new physics.

## Wednesday

* FW1F.4 Amplifiers are *not* linear. I should read this paper more carefully!

* FW4E.1 New poling to make heralded single photons with 99% purity. Should read this paper too. I do not understand how their poling works.

* FW1F.7 They claimed some really hard to understand things. Should look at this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03483.pdf

* FW4E.3 Nongaussian and gaussian nonclassical states of light with combs.

* FW4E.5 Compressed sensing together with complicated network to make just one measurement that gives access to a near pure unknown states via compressed sensing.

* FW4E.6 Doing photon subtraction via a beam-splitter provided by FC. I should learn about photon subtraction. Have a look to qoqi.comxa.com

## Thursday

* JTh1E.1  What can be done with integrated photonics.

* JTh1E.3 Making micropillars with QDs and the integrating them in chips. NEAT

* FTh4E.1 Schmidt-Frequency modes for QI. Time-ordering effects!

* FTh4E.5 Using a cavity to make SPDC single photons compatible with quantum memories. They have a frequency comb where the tooth are coherent for very long separations.

## Friday
* FF1E.1 Explore different trade offs in detectors. Also there is Swedish company starting to commercialize these things.

* FF2E.5 High FC. They care about all sorts of parasitic photons (e.g. Raman)  that could potentially be upconverted giving rise to noise. NEAT
