This repository contains some cheat sheets that I found useful while taking courses 
on quantum mechanics and atomic and molecular physics.
Note that the cheat sheet for the del operator in different coordinate systems
used to be available at [the wikipedia page for the del operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates).
It is still there but there is no nice pdf ready-to-be-printed version.
Note that the original file from wikipedia is DelWiki.pdf. This file has a minor typo (the word Operation is misspelled as Operaion). 
They also contain some interesting (but by no means original) results related to some properties of the classical and quantum harmonic oscillator.
